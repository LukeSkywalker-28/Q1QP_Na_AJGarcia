        <h3> Sometimes, the pace of modern life barely gives you time to stop and rest. It can make getting a good nights sleep on a regular basis seem like a dream.
            But sleep is as important for good health as diet and exercise. Good sleep improves your brain performance, mood, and health.
            Not getting enough quality sleep regularly raises the risk of many diseases and disorders. These range from heart disease and stroke to obesity and dementia.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout your life. The way you feel while you are awake depends in part on what happens while you are sleeping. During sleep, your body is working to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health.
        In children and teens, sleep also helps <br>
         support growth and development. Getting inadequate sleep over time can raise your risk for chronic (long-term) health problems. It can also affect how well you think, react, work, learn, and get along with others. Learn how sleep affects your heart and circulatory system.
